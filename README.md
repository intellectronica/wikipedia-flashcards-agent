# AI-Assisted Coding Workshop: Building with AI Coding Agents

This is a hands-on workshop about **working with AI coding agents**. You'll learn how to plan and specify requirements, provide context, and build software interactively using AI coding tools.

The project we'll build together is a **multi-agent system** that automatically creates flashcards from Wikipedia articles — but the real focus is on **learning to code with AI**.

You'll learn:
- 🎯 **How to plan and specify requirements** for AI-assisted development
- 📝 **How to provide effective context** to AI coding tools
- 💬 **How to communicate with AI agents** to get the code you want
- 🔄 **How to iterate and refine** when AI doesn't get it right the first time
- 🐛 **How to debug** with AI assistance
- 🏗️ **How to build incrementally** — testing each component before moving forward
- 🤖 **Real-world AI coding workflows** used by professionals

**The flashcard generator** is our vehicle for learning these skills. By the end, you'll have:
- ✅ A working multi-agent system
- ✅ Practical experience with AI-assisted development
- ✅ Techniques you can apply to any coding project

**No prior experience with AI coding tools required** — just bring your curiosity!

## 🛠 Workshop Flow

This 60-minute workshop teaches you **how to build with AI coding agents** through hands-on development of a multi-agent flashcard generator. We chose this architecture because each agent is self-contained and testable — perfect for learning incremental AI-assisted development.

**Introduction (5 min):** Live demo of the complete system, then explain the architecture and how we'll build it using AI-assisted development.

**Building the System (45 min):** We'll build three components incrementally:
1. **Research Agent** — Search Wikipedia and evaluate content (learn: planning, providing context, iteration)
2. **Analyser Agent** — Extract structured concepts from text (learn: requesting structured output, refinement, debugging)
3. **Flashcard Designer** — Generate pedagogical Q&A pairs (learn: few-shot prompting, quality control)

**Q&A / Discussion (10+ min):** Open floor for questions about AI-assisted coding techniques, challenges, and best practices.
