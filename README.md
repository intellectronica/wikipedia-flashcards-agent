# AI-Assisted Coding Workshop: Building with AI Coding Agents

This is a hands-on workshop about **working with AI coding agents**. You'll learn how to plan and specify requirements, provide context, and build software interactively using AI coding tools.

The project we'll build together is a **multi-agent system** that automatically creates flashcards from Wikipedia articles — but the real focus is on **learning to code with AI**.

You'll learn:
- 🎯 **How to plan and specify requirements** for AI-assisted development
- 📝 **How to provide effective context** to AI coding tools
- 💬 **How to communicate with AI agents** to get the code you want
- 🔄 **How to iterate and refine** when AI doesn't get it right the first time
- 🐛 **How to debug** with AI assistance
- 🏗️ **How to build incrementally** — testing each component before moving forward
- 🤖 **Real-world AI coding workflows** used by professionals

**The flashcard generator** is our vehicle for learning these skills. By the end, you'll have:
- ✅ A working multi-agent system
- ✅ Practical experience with AI-assisted development
- ✅ Techniques you can apply to any coding project

**No prior experience with AI coding tools required** — just bring your curiosity!
